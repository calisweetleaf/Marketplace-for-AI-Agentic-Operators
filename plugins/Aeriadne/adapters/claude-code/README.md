# Claude Code Adapter — Aeriadne

## Goal

Document the Claude Code projection of Aeriadne without making Claude-specific files canonical.

## Package source

```text
/home/daeron/Repositories/Somnus-Intellligence-Stack/plugins/Aeriadne
```

## Projection rules

- Preserve `skills/constitutional-prompt-framework/SKILL.md` and `skills/aeriadne-marketplace-operator/SKILL.md` frontmatter and references.
- Project `agents/subagents/*.md` into Claude agent/subagent prompt slots only after review.
- Keep Claude settings/commands out of the canonical skill unless they are placed under a Claude-specific adapter/generated folder.
- Treat `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` as a metadata mirror, not the only source of truth.
- Ignore `plugins/old/_archived-plugin-descriptors/` during active install or marketplace build.

## Current status

Adapter docs exist; no Claude plugin install was performed in this pass.
